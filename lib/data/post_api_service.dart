      ///
      /// The nature of interceptors is that they run with every request or response performed on a ChopperClient. If you want to perform a client-wide operation, interceptors are just the right thing to employ.
      ///
      /// The word "client-wide" is important. In the previous part, you learned that Chopper has the concept of a ChopperService - it contains methods for making requests. One service is usually reserved for one endpoint (e.g. "/posts", "/comments") and usually there are multiple services per one ChopperClient (e.g. PostService + CommentService).
      ///
      /// Do you want to keep a statistic of how many times a certain URL has been called? Do you want to add headers to every request? Do you want to tell the user to switch to WiFi when he's about to download a large file? All of this is a job for an interceptor.
      ///
      /// As you've learned above, interceptors are applied to the whole ChopperClient. They will therefore be specified inside the client's constructor. Even though there are two types of interceptors - request & response, they are both added into one list parameter.

      interceptors: [
        // Both request & response interceptors go here

        /// [Built-in interceptors]
        /// Being an awesome library, Chopper comes bundled with a couple of useful interceptors.
        ///
        /// [1. HeadersInterceptor]
        /// One of these interceptors is a HeadersInterceptor which will add headers to all of the requests performed by the ChopperClient. Headers are a Map<String, String>. Add the folowing to the interceptors list on a client:
        HeadersInterceptor({'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'}),

        /// [2. HttpLoggingInterceptor]
        /// The other built-in interceptors are made for debugging purposes.
        ///
        /// HttpLoggingInterceptor is a very useful tool for finding out detailed information about requests and responses. Once you set it up, you'll see detailed logs such as this one:
        HttpLoggingInterceptor(),

        /// [3. CurlInterceptor]
        /// This is the last built-in one. If you're not very good with CURL and you'd like to see the CURL command for the request made by the app, add the following:
        ///
        /// Then, after making GET or POST requests through Chopper, you'll get it printed out in the console. Again, follow the above steps to enable logging with the logging package.
        CurlInterceptor(),

        /// [4. Custom interceptors]
        /// Creating your own interceptors to run custom logic before requests or after responses can be done in 2 ways:
        /// 1. Simple anonymous functions
        /// 2. Classes implementing RequestInterceptor or ResponseInterceptor
        ///
        /// [a. Anonymous functions]
        /// These are perfect for quick little interceptors which don't contain a lot of logic. Usually, it's better to use the second option - create a separate class. Otherwise you might end up with a messy codebase. As always, single responsibility principle (SRP) is king!
        ///
        /// If you'd rather trade in SRP for quickness, this is how you define anonymous interceptors. Again, all of this goes into the interceptors list of the ChopperClient.
        ///
        /// Request and response interceptors differ only in the type of their parameter.
        ///
        /// Interceptors have to always return a request/response. Otherwise, the next called interceptor or other Chopper code will receive a null request/response. And you know what happens with nulls... ðŸ˜¬
